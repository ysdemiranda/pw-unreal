= pw-unreal (WIP)

pw-unreal is an attempt to interface Unreal Engine and PipeWire.

== Summaries

=== Goals

1. Capturing and processing audio data through Blueprint-spawned PipeWire nodes at runtime
2. Visualizing this audio data with cool Unreal Engine capabilites

=== Working

* Including and compiling libpipewire-0.3 headers in plugin's source +
In `Source/unrealpw/unrealpw.Build.cs`

* Linking against libpipewire-0.3 shared objects +
In `Source/unrealpw/unrealpw.Build.cs`

* Initializing libpipewire using `pw_init(...)` +
In `Source/unrealpw/Private/unrealpw.cpp`

* Implementing "Tutorial 3: Forcing a Roundtrip" from the official Pipewire API docs +
In `Source/unrealpw/Roundtrip.cpp`

=== Challenges

* Integrating and using the `pw_thread_loop` structure since we're implementing in Unreal Engine's +
game loop system
